        <h1><a href="/">Canvas City</a> Infrequently Asked Questions</h1>
        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <p>
        A publicly-editable pixel canvas tied to your current location. Think of
        it as MS Paint with a brush the size of a city block.
        </p>

        <h2>Who made it?</h2>
        <p><a href="http://jacobandreas.net">I did</a>.</p>

        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>I decided to play with <a href="http://nodejs.org">node.js</a> and <a
            href="http://redis.io">redis</a> this week.  Collaborative paint is
        a standard first app in node; I thought this would be a fun
        variation.</p>

        <h2>Why just Manhattan?</h2>
        <p>Because I go to Columbia, and can't fit a hi-res map of the entire
        universe in memory.</p>

        <h2>I can do a better job.</h2>
